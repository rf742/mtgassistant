I don't enjoy having to download apps on my phone for simple tasks.
This page is an alternative to downloading life tracker apps for commander games. It keeps
track of your life total, commander damage, and poison counters during an EDH game. 

Links are also included to search cards and rulings.

This page is a nice example of how pleasant alpine.js is to use, which provides
all the interactivity in this page --> [alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev).

See it running live through Github Pages here:
